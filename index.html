                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                    <h3>Talking a little about me...</h3>
<p>
    Since I was a little girl, I've always been curious about how the world of technology worked.
    I was wondering why things worked the way they did.
    After studying a little about the subject I fell in love with the area.
    It really is very impressive to have the possibility to create practically everything with your own hands.
</p>

<p>After that, I started studying to fulfill my dream of becoming a programmer.</p>
<p>
    I am a very dedicated and empathetic person, I really like helping people and working as a team. I believe that teamwork is a great opportunity to create friendships and share knowledge for the benefit of all.
    I am always studying and taking courses to improve my knowledge.
</p>
<p>
    I recognize that I need to improve a lot.
    I like to test things and I'm very resistant, I don't usually give up.
    I'm very optimistic, so I'll give my all to be a great professional in the field.
</p>
                   <p>Here is the space for you to get to know me better! <span>Let's go!</span></p>
